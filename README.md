# LDSoftware-Commons
This project was thought to provide a series of useful and solid ground from where to begin writing "management" software.

It features basic entities that can be found in almost every management software and basic VAADIN forms to edit them.
From this ground every developer can create their own entity classes and editing forms really easily.

This readme will soon contain more info on how to get started, as soon as I manage to finalise the first version.
