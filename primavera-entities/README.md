# primavera-entities
This artifact provides an interface towards the Primavera services. Any project needing to make REST requests
to any project powered by primavera-rest should incorporate this artifact.

The artifact is left with just the DTOs in order to remain lightweight, and to avoid forcing imports that
are not needed to other applications.
